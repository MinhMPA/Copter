Welcome to Copter!

Introduction
------------
Copter is a software package for doing calculations in cosmological
perturbation theory.  Specifically, Copter includes code for computing
statistical observables in the large-scale structure of matter using various
forms of perturbation theory, including linear theory, standard perturbation
theory, renormalized perturbation theory, and many others.  For a fuller
description of the various theories, see arXiv:0905.0479 and references
therein.


Requirements
------------
Copter is written in C++, so you'll need a relatively modern C++ compiler (e.g.
g++).  Copter makes use of the GNU Scientific Library (GSL), which you will
need to have installed somewhere on your system.  It also makes use of parts of
the Boost C++ library, but the relevant header files are included with Copter
(in the src/boost directory), so you do not need to install it yourself.

To build the optional Python bindings, you'll need
  1) a recent version of SWIG (usually located at /usr/bin/swig).
  2) Python development headers (usually found in /usr/include/pythonM.N),
  3) Numpy development headers (usually found in /usr/include/numpy)
The configure script (described below) should find the relevant files
automagically.


Building and Installing
-----------------------
Copter should compile on any standard Unix-like machine (including Linux and
OS X).  It makes use of GNU Autotools, which is the standard build system for
most open source software today.  For you, the user, installation is as simple
as entering the three commands
  $ ./configure [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
  $ make
  $ make install

The installation directory is determined by the options you pass to the
'configure' script.  The most important options are:
  --prefix=PREFIX   top-level installation directory (defaults to /usr/local,
                      so you probably want to specify this option)
  --enable-openmp   use OpenMP to parallelize expensive loops (default yes)
  --enable-python   build Python bindings (default no)
By default 'make' will use the standard system compiler.  To use a different
compiler, append 'CXX=<preferred C++ compiler>' to your configure command.
Try `./configure --help' to see a full list of options.

Running 'make install' will install the library 'libcopter.so' to 'PREFIX/lib',
the corresponding C++ header files to 'PREFIX/include/Copter', and some
standard data files to 'PREFIX/share/Copter'.  If Python bindings are enabled,
they will be installed to 'PREFIX/lib/pythonM.N/site-packages'.

For example, to install Copter to your home directory (~/lib, ~/include, etc.)
using the Intel compiler, you would run
  $ ./configure --prefix=$HOME --enable-openmp CXX=icpc
  $ make && make install
